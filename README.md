# Pokemon Showdown Random Team Generator
developed by KlausRÃ¼diger and ArchmageMomo

## teamgenerator.py
This is the main script for generating teams. At the moment, the following generation methods are supported:
- Fullrandom: Completely random Pokemon, moves and abilities are picked out of all existing ones in gen 7. Only playable in custom battles
- Legitrandom: Random Pokemon are picked and get moves and abilities that it could realistically have in-game. Some currently unpreventable errors due to moves that can't be used at the same time due to limited availability from events or being impossible to receive through breeding at the same time. Most of the time the output teams are playable in Uber.
- Structuredrandom: Picks randomly from premade sets and movesets. Playable in Uber. Currently WIP since the sets are written manually and we don't have unlimited amounts of free time.
